## 1. What is the Big O for this?
   1. Constant time
   2. Linear time
## 2. Even or odd
   Constant time since it doesn't matter what the value of is, it will always take the same amount of time to run.
## 3. Are You Here?
   Polynomial time, O(n^2), since there is a nested for loop.
## 4. Doubler
   Linear time since the run time depends on the size of array that it is operating on.
## 5. Naive search
   Linear time since the run time depends on the size of the array that you are looking for the item in
## 6. Creating pairs
   Polynomial time, O(n^2), since there is a nested for loop.
## 7.  Compute the sequence
   The function creates the fibonacci sequence. Linear time since the run time depends on the number that is supplied as a parameter.
